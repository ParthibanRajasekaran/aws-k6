# CI/CD Setup Summary

## Current State
This project now has a **simplified, single-workflow CI/CD setup** focused solely on Lambda and S3 integration testing.

## Workflow: `basic-test.yml`
**Location:** `.github/workflows/basic-test.yml`

### What it does:
1. **Install Dependencies** - Sets up Node.js 20 and installs npm packages
2. **Run Unit Tests** - Executes Jest unit tests for Lambda functions
3. **Start LocalStack** - Starts LocalStack with Lambda and S3 services using Docker
4. **Install/Update AWS CLI** - Handles pre-existing AWS CLI installations properly
5. **Test LocalStack** - Verifies S3 bucket creation and connectivity
6. **Deploy Lambda** - Creates and deploys the Lambda function to LocalStack
7. **Test Lambda** - Invokes the Lambda function and verifies response
8. **Start API Gateway Sim** - Tests the Express.js API gateway simulation
9. **Cleanup** - Stops services and cleans up resources

### Key Improvements:
- ✅ **Robust AWS CLI Installation** - Handles pre-existing installations with `--update` flag
- ✅ **Better LocalStack Health Checks** - Waits for specific services (S3, Lambda) to be available
- ✅ **Proper Error Handling** - Fails fast on critical issues, shows logs for troubleshooting
- ✅ **No Static Analysis** - Removed linting from CI pipeline as requested
- ✅ **Single Workflow** - Simplified from multiple complex workflows to one focused workflow

## What was removed:
- ❌ All other workflow files (ci-cd.yml, lambda-s3.yml, etc.)
- ❌ Static code analysis/linting from CI pipeline
- ❌ Complex multi-job workflows
- ❌ Redundant test configurations

## Local Development:
- Linting is still available locally via `npm run _lint` (optional)
- All K6 performance tests can still be run locally
- LocalStack integration works as before

## Expected GitHub Actions Behavior:
The workflow should now pass consistently by:
1. Properly handling AWS CLI installation conflicts
2. Waiting for LocalStack services to be fully available
3. Testing only the core Lambda+S3 functionality
4. Providing clear error messages if something fails

## Next Steps:
Monitor GitHub Actions runs to ensure the workflow passes reliably. If any issues arise, they should now be easier to debug with the improved logging and error handling.
