# GitHub Actions Workflow Summary

## ✅ Workflow Created: `.github/workflows/ci-cd-localstack.yml`

### Key Features:
- **Single, comprehensive workflow** that covers all testing phases
- **LocalStack integration** for AWS service simulation
- **Parallel job execution** for efficiency
- **Comprehensive testing** including unit tests, integration tests, and K6 performance tests
- **Security scanning** with npm audit
- **Detailed reporting** with artifacts and summaries

### Jobs Overview:

#### 1. Unit Tests (`unit-tests`)
- Runs Jest unit tests with coverage
- Uploads test results and coverage reports
- Timeout: 15 minutes

#### 2. Integration & E2E Tests (`integration-tests`)
- Sets up LocalStack with Lambda, S3, and other AWS services
- Deploys Lambda function with proper IAM roles
- Tests both direct Lambda invocation and API Gateway simulation
- Runs K6 performance tests (skipped on PRs by default)
- Timeout: 30 minutes

#### 3. Security & Quality Check (`security-check`)
- Runs npm audit for security vulnerabilities
- Fails on high or critical vulnerabilities
- Timeout: 10 minutes

#### 4. Summary Report (`summary`)
- Generates comprehensive pipeline summary
- Creates PR comments with test results
- Always runs regardless of other job outcomes

### Environment Variables:
- `NODE_VERSION`: Configurable (default: 20)
- `AWS_*`: LocalStack test credentials
- `BUCKET_NAME`: Unique per run using `github.run_id`
- `LOCALSTACK_HOST`: localhost
- `ENDPOINT`: http://localhost:4566
- `API_URL`: http://localhost:3000

### Manual Workflow Controls:
- `skip_performance`: Skip K6 performance tests
- `node_version`: Choose Node.js version (18, 20, 22)

### Validation Status:
✅ **All validations passed**
- Lambda handler found
- Dependencies properly included
- AWS SDK and LRU Cache detected
- K6 scripts syntax verified
- Docker and LocalStack ready

### Test Coverage:
- Unit tests with Jest
- Integration tests with real AWS services (via LocalStack)
- API Gateway simulation testing
- K6 performance testing for both GET and POST endpoints
- Security vulnerability scanning

### Artifacts Generated:
- Unit test results and coverage reports
- Integration test results
- K6 performance test results
- LocalStack logs
- Security audit results
- Consolidated test reports

### Performance Features:
- Caching for npm dependencies
- Parallel job execution where possible
- Optimized LocalStack configuration
- Background process management

The workflow is production-ready and should provide comprehensive CI/CD coverage for your LocalStack Lambda S3 project.
