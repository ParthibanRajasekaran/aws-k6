- ✅ Pull requests to `main` or `develop`
- ✅ Manual workflow dispatch with custom parameters

### Optional Setup
Add these repository secrets for enhanced features:
```bash
# Optional - for LocalStack Pro features
LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Optional - for enhanced Codecov integration
CODECOV_TOKEN=your_token_here
```
